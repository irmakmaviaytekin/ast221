# ast221


This repository contains my completed assignments for AST221 (Stars & Galaxies).
The work includes Python-based data analysis, astrophysical calculations, and scientific visualizations completed in Jupyter Notebooks.

Each assignment uses real astronomical data, numerical methods, and physical models to explore how we measure and understand stars, planets, and the structure of the universe.


Skills Demonstrated

Astropy, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib
Linear regression on astrophysical power laws
Parsing and analyzing real astronomical data
Logarithmic transformations & uncertainty reasoning
Scientific communication using Markdown + Jupyter
Physics-based modeling (gravity, orbits, mass estimation)
