    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook will serve as the template the third question on Assignment 4. You will be working through the content it contains and then filling in your own work in the spaces provided. In order to complete this assignment you will require the following (all of which will be provided to you):\n",
    "\n",
    "* The file Stein_mags.txt, which contains information on the magnitude of the asteroid Stein's versus time. More information is given on the data below.\n",
    "* The file Test_LightCurve2.csv. This contains the light curve of a Cepheid variable. You do not need it for you final answer/analysis related to asteroids, but you can experiment with it below to get a handle on the idea of phase folding a light curve (we have provided you with the true period for this object below)\n",

    "In the sections below, every individual sub-questions have been written in <span style=\"color:red\"> Red Text </span>. Some questions require you to make edits to bits of code that we have provided, in which case we specify the specific lines you are required to edit. Other questions are short answer (paragraph) format, asking you to summarize what you learned from various portions of the activity. In cases where paragraph-stype answers are required, we have indicated where you should enter your responses in <span style=\"color:blue\"> Blue Text.</span>\n",

    "## Further Information on the Data\n",

    "In the file 'stein_mags.txt' are measurements of the apparent magnitude of asteroid Stein's, a target for the Rosetta mission. The observations were taken with the OSIRIS scientific camera that was part of the Rosetta spacecraft. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most famously, Rosetta orbited Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, and sent a lander, Philae, to the surface. Before that, it did a flyby of asteroid Stein's. Stein's is in the main asteroid belt. You can find more information on the Rosetta mission [here](esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Rosetta). \n",
    "\n",
    "The data on asteroid Stein's were published in the journal article \"Determination of the light curve of the Rosetta target asteroid (2867) Steins by the OSIRIS cameras onboard Rosetta\" by Kuppers et al. (2007) ([link](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full/2007/04/aa6694-06/aa6694-06.html)). \n",
    "\n",
    "The file contains two columns: date in Modified Julian Date (MJD), and apparent magnitude at a wavelength of 600 nm. A definition of MJD can be found [here](https://scienceworld.wolfram.com/astronomy/ModifiedJulianDate.html). Your goal is to use the data to estimate the rotational period of the asteroid."

    "\n",
    "Phase folding can be a tricky concept at first, but this will show you how it works, by using the test data in 'Test_LightCurve2.csv'. This is actually a light curve for a Cepheid variable star; so nothing to do with asteroids. But it will let you experiment before you work on the Stein light curve. In particular:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Now, spend some time experimenting with line 16 of the code. By editing this line you are testing whether a certain period works for the data you have. Here, line 17 will phase fold the data based on the period you entered, and then the data will be plotted by lines 20-26. See what happen when you run this on the test data with a period guess of 10 days. Now try with a period guess of 6.167. Do you see a difference. 6.167 is the true period of the star we have given you for test data. See how the plot changes as you slowly move away from this value.\n",
    "* Now try changing line 17 to read 12.334. This is twice the actual period of the star. Do you understand how you can tell this from the plot? The data points should be lined up with one another, but you should see two 'rises' and 'falls' of the stars brightness.\n",
    "* Finally, demonstrate what the plot looksl like if you select half the true period.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the biggest differences between asteroids and Cepheid variable stars is that it is possible that the asteroid could rise and fall more than one in the same 'period' (it is not as regular and depends on the shape, etc. as it is turning). But you are looking again for when you see a pattern that then repeats again. Once you are done experiementing here and think you get the general idea, please go to the next cell. "

This code essenetially tries phase folding your star by 15000 different periods between 0.05 and 0.3 days and tries to estimate how well it worked. Run the block of code and examine the plot that is produced in order to determine roughly what what your period lies in. Feel free to zoom in on the x-axis by modifying line 44. **Please see the quercus instructions for a description of what this is doing how to interpret this plot**. \n",

Remember, what you are trying to do here is find the period where the overall 'scatter' in the phase folded light curve seems the lowest. Explore the entire area around any minima that appear in the first plot and if there are two minima that are similar depths in the first plot, explore them both (keeping in mind what was said above: asteroids can sometime have more complex light curves that go up/down more than once in one rotation period; so you are looking for where the overall scatter appears the smallest). \n",
